<h1>Hi. Welcome</h1>

<p>
  I'm Steve, a senior at University of Washington studying computer science.

<h3>Portfolio Statement</h3>

<p>
I came into the University of Washington thinking I had a clear path to graduation. I would major in computer science and mathematics and perform research in a lab. Turns out that plans which seem so clear when starting out do not survive the test of college. Along the way, I've learned it's hard to tell what you're really motivated by, but I think my time here at UW has let me explore some possibilities that I wouldn't have otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Part of the plan did stay intact. I will graduate with a degree in computer science and had the opportunity to do research in the Programming Languages and Software Engineering lab for almost two years. The research I worked on pushed me intellectually more than any other project ever has, and I'm much more informed on how the edge of human knowledge is developed as a result. But I also realized that a career in research (i.e., graduate school) was not for me. Although I enjoyed working on the cutting edge of computer science, I truly want to build complete systems that people can enjoy and use. This led me to join the Formula SAE club where I've been working on developing circuit boards and software for the combustion and electric cars that the team builds every year. The club attracts motivated individuals from all types of engineering, so I have been able to learn the skills needed to make high performance, real things (instead of virtual things like software). Furthermore, I've been stretched intellectually to learn electronics and basic electrical engineering without the support of formal courses, motivated by the desire to make the best race cars possible. These two experiences have showed me different ways of creating and contributing knowledge and have directed the path I am taking going forward.

After I graduate I'll be working as a Software Engineering at Google. But even though that will be the conclusion of my time at college it is just the beginning of a life-long journey of learning and discovery. My day job will likely involve working on the virtual world, so I want to use my spare time (new concept!) to explore how to combine multiple engineering disciplines and design concepts to create innovations. With a formal education in Computer Science, I have a perspective on the world that lets me see problems and solutions in a different light. I'll continue to explore what motivates me and find ways to embrace that in a positive way. As one plan concludes another one is forming and I'm excited to see the results. I don't know where I'll end up, but I plan to embrace however the plan changes.
