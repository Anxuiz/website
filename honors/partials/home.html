<h1>Hi. Welcome</h1>

<p>
  I'm Steve, a freshman at University of Washington studying computer science.
  I also am quite interested in mathematics and will be applying to the
  Applied Computational &amp; Mathematical Sciences (ACMS) in the spring.
  Outside of academics, I enjoy badminton (I try to play 2 times a week!), car
  racing (especially Rally and Rallycross), and action movies. In my free time
  I help run the <a href="https://oc.tc" target="_blank">Overcast Network</a>
  Minecraft servers as a developer and systems administrator.
</p>

<p>
  Enough biography. Welcome to my honor's portfolio, where I document my
  journey through the University and the honors program. Just starting out as
  a freshman this year I look forward to exploring what I find interesting and
  learning about new things. For now I'm fairly certain of my interest in
  computer science and mathematics but unsure of what I want to do within
  those broad areas of study. Oh well, that's what the next four years are
  for!

  The portfolio is a little bare at the moment since I just started it out. Go
  ahead and use the navigation bar at the top to explore and find out what
  I've been up to!
