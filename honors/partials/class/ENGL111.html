<h2>Composition: Literature</h2>

<p>
  ENGL 111 is a basic requirement for composition at UW, so I didn't
  originally put much thought into it. I know I wanted to do something with
  literature because I enjoy writing about books and stories more than random
  topics. One thing that makes ENGL 111 unique is that each section is taught
  by a different grad student in English, but you don't know who will be your
  instructor or what the class will be like until basically the first day. I
  remember telling myself, "As long as I don't get someone who teaches 16th
  century poetry, I'll be alright."

  Well, that's what I got. Imagine my surprise when I walk in day one and find
  out we'll be spending the entire quarter reading Paradise Lost, a 17th
  century English epic that makes Shakespeare seem like light reading. The
  class had to be the most hardcore ENGL 111 section that quarter, and though
  I remember it being difficult I was glad to have an instructor who was
  extremely interested in the topic every class and wanted to share his
  enthusiam for it with everyone in the class.

  This course made my high school literature class seem like a cakewalk, but
  in my struggles with the material and connecting ideas I wrote one of my
  favorite papers here at UW. In this paper I draw an analogy between Satan in
  Paradise Lost and Lou from the movie Nightcrawler. It was fun to compare
  a weighty character from a very classic piece of literature to a movie I had
  just seen a few months before.
