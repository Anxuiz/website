<p>
  Coming out of high school I had a considerable amount of programming
  experience so I considered trying to skip this class. However, I noticed it
  covered additional topics which I did not at the time feel entirely
  comfortable with. So I took the class with the honors section and found it
  to be interesting at times and boring at other times.

<h3>Evil Hangman</h3>

<p>
  CSE 143 gives weekly programming assignments. Evil Hangman was the
  assignment from Week 4.
</p>

<p>
  In normal Hangman, the first player picks a word that the second player has
  to guess. But what if the first player didn't pick a word at the beginning
  and tried to delay the choice for as long as possible? That's what we have
  here.
